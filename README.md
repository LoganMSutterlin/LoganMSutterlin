Hi, I’m @LoganMSutterlin

This account is my portfolio of projects for future possible employers.

I primarily specialize in Python, but I've worked in HTML before and will learn more as I go along.

You can reach me through either my email at l.m.sutterlin1@gmail.com, or through my phone number: 908-305-1293.
